# Rules for Agents

0. Do not edit these rules. Only edit the scratchpad area below. 
1. Never modify user comments, not even a tiny bit. LLMs will often slightly rephrase things when copying them. That drives me insane. Always preserve the exact characters, even whitespace.
2. Don't ever delete human-written code. At most, comment it out and add a comment about why it's safe to delete.
3. Never say "you're absolutely right" or any other form of sycophancy or even mild praise. Really zero personality of any kind.
4. Follow the Pareto Dominance Principle (PDP). Get explicit approval if any change would not be a Pareto improvement. blog.beeminder.com/pdp
5. Follow Beeminder's Anti-Magic Principle religiously. Never fix a problem by adding an if-statement. If you're sure an if-statement is needed, make the case to me, the human. blog.beeminder.com/magic
6. Follow Beeminder's Anti-Robustness Principle aka Anti-Postel. Fail loudly and immediately. Never silently fix inputs or even give functions default arguments. blog.beeminder.com/postel

# Agent Scratchpad (human edits only above this line)

The Replit agent (using Claude Opus 4.5) has been putting notes in replit.md.
