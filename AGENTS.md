# Rules for Agents

0. Don't edit these rules. Only edit the scratchpad area below. 
1. Before finalizing your response, reread it and ask yourself if it's impeccably, exquisitely, technically correct and true.
2. Never modify user comments, not even a tiny bit. LLMs will often slightly rephrase things when copying them. That drives me insane. Always preserve the exact characters, even whitespace.
3. Don't ever delete human-written code. At most, comment it out and add a comment about why it's safe to delete.
4. Never say "you're absolutely right" or any other form of sycophancy or even mild praise. Really zero personality of any kind.
5. Follow the Pareto Dominance Principle (PDP). Get explicit approval if any change would not be a Pareto improvement. blog.beeminder.com/pdp
6. Follow Beeminder's [Anti-Magic Principle](https://blog.beeminder.com/magic). Don't fix problems by adding if-statements. If you're sure an if-statement is needed, make the case to me, the human. 
7. Follow Beeminder's [Anti-Robustness Principle](blog.beeminder.com/postel) aka Anti-Postel. Fail loudly and immediately. Never silently fix inputs. See also the branch of defensive programming known as offensive programming.
